# Peepo App üê∏

**Peepo App** is an e-commerce web aplication with Augmented Reality for Android

(Now it is still in development)

This aplication is basically an e-commerce app with Augmented Reality. Every product has its 3d model to visualize it in AR. This feature needs an specific Android Version.

The app is responsive (that means it will work in any device) but it has some aditional features when it is used in an Android Phone.

We needed Google ArCore to build 3d models.
